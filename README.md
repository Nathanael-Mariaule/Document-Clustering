# Document-Clustering

## Introduction
The Kleister Charity Dataset is dataset that contains PDF files published by British charities.
The dataset is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/applicaai/kleister-charity) and was extracted from https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission.

 As project during AI BeCode Training, I was asked to use clustering algorithms to give structure to this dataset and help a fictive company to sort the document.
 
## Sequenced Clustering


## Clusters Description
Here are each cluster I obtained and words with highest mean tfidf-score within:
 * School/College:
  'august', 'school', 'scheme', 'statements', 'assets', 'accounts', 'funds', 'costs', 'governors', 'pupils', 'college', 'schools'
 * Church
  'december', 'church', 'activities', 'statements', 'assets', 'accounts', 'nas', 'funds', 'members', 'costs', 'pcc', 'matters', 'baptist', 'nat'
 * Club
 * Art/Festival
 * Camp/scout
 * University/research
 * International
 * Pension
 * River
 * Park/Museum
 * School/August
 * Examination
 * Liabililities/Policies
 * Other (anything that don't fall into the previous clusters)
 
 
 
 

## Further improvements
- cosine-similarity
- split large cluster
- communication with company
